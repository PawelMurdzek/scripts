SOLUTION SUMMARY
================

Problem: Modular Binomials Challenge
Given: N, e1, e2, c1, c2
Find: p, q such that N = p * q

Constraints:
- m1 = 2*p + 3*q
- m2 = 5*p + 7*q  
- c1 = m1^e1 mod N
- c2 = m2^e2 mod N

Key Observations:
1. e1 and e2 are HUGE (512 bits each)
2. e1 * e2 is exactly 1024 bits (half of N's 2048 bits)
3. gcd(e1, e2) = 1
4. Direct root extraction is computationally infeasible

Approaches Attempted:
=====================

Approach 1: Common Modulus Attack
- Used Bezout's identity: a*e1 + b*e2 = 1
- Problem: Gives combination of m1 and m2, not individual values
- Status: FAILED

Approach 2: Factorization Methods
- Tried trial division, Fermat's method, Pollard's rho
- Status: FAILED (N is a strong RSA modulus)

Approach 3: Testing if e1, e2 are decryption exponents
- Computed m1 = c1^e1 mod N, m2 = c2^e2 mod N
- Solved linear system for p, q
- Status: FAILED (p*q != N)

Approach 4: Small Exponent Roots  
- Tested if c1, c2 are perfect k-th powers for small k
- Status: TOO SLOW (Newton's method with large numbers)

Approach 5: Franklin-Reiter Related Message Attack
- Requires polynomial GCD operations
- Status: Needs SageMath

Approach 6: Low Public Exponent Attack
- Tested common exponents (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 65537)
- Status: FAILED (no small exponent found)

Approach 7: Alternative Interpretations
- Checked GCDs, tested if c1/c2 are m1/m2 directly
- Status: FAILED

Approach 8: Wiener-like Analysis
- Analyzed e1/N, e2/N ratios
- Tested if e1*e_test ≡ 1 (mod phi(N)) for small e_test
- Status: FAILED

Approach 9: Systematic Testing
- Tested all combinations: c1^e1, c1^e2, etc.
- Status: ALL FAILED

Approach 10: Phi(N) Extraction
- Tested if e1*e2 = 1 + k*phi(N) for small k
- Status: FAILED

Approach 11: Product Analysis
- Noticed e1*e2 is exactly 1024 bits
- Tested if e1, e2 are p, q or close to them
- Status: FAILED

Approach 12: Creative Bezout Usage
- Used c1^a * c2^b where a*e1 + b*e2 = 1
- Status: Gives a combination, not solution

CONCLUSION:
===========

This problem REQUIRES one of the following:

1. **SageMath** with Groebner bases or polynomial resultants
   - Can solve the polynomial system:
     * (2p + 3q)^e1 ≡ c1 (mod N)
     * (5p + 7q)^e2 ≡ c2 (mod N)
     * p * q = N

2. **Coppersmith's Attack** for finding small roots of polynomials mod N
   - Python implementation would require significant crypto libraries

3. **A mathematical insight** that reduces the problem to something simpler
   - Possibly exploiting the specific values of e1, e2
   - Or a relationship between the linear combinations (2,3) and (5,7)

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
Run the solve_sagemath.py script with SageMath installed:
    sage solve_sagemath.py

Or use an online SageMath notebook at https://sagecell.sagemath.org/
