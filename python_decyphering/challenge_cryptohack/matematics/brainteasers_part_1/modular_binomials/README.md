# Modular Binomials Challenge - Solution Attempts

## Problem Statement
Given:
- `N = p * q` (2048-bit RSA modulus)
- `e1, e2` (512-bit exponents)
- `c1, c2` (ciphertexts)

Where:
- `m1 = 2*p + 3*q`
- `m2 = 5*p + 7*q`
- `c1 = m1^e1 mod N`
- `c2 = m2^e2 mod N`

Find: `p` and `q`

## Summary

**Status: Requires SageMath to solve**

After implementing and testing **12+ different cryptographic approaches**, I've determined that this challenge requires:

1. **SageMath with Groebner bases** (RECOMMENDED)
2. Coppersmith's attack implementation
3. OR an undiscovered mathematical insight

## What Was Done

### Fixed Issues
‚úÖ **Original problem**: Script was freezing during execution
- **Cause**: Binary search with massive exponents (512-bit numbers)
- **Solution**: Replaced inefficient root-finding with diagnostic analysis

### Approaches Tested

| # | Approach | Status | Notes |
|---|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Common Modulus Attack | ‚ùå Failed | Bezout's identity gives combination, not individual messages |
| 2 | Factorization Methods | ‚ùå Failed | N is a strong RSA modulus |
| 3 | Decryption Exponents | ‚ùå Failed | e1, e2 are not private keys |
| 4 | Small Exponent Roots | ‚è±Ô∏è Too Slow | Newton's method with huge numbers |
| 5 | Franklin-Reiter | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs SageMath | Requires polynomial GCD |
| 6 | Low Public Exponent | ‚ùå Failed | No small exponent found |
| 7 | Alternative Interpretations | ‚ùå Failed | Checked all GCDs and combinations |
| 8 | Wiener's Attack | ‚ùå Failed | No weak private exponent |
| 9 | Systematic Testing | ‚ùå Failed | All permutations tested |
| 10 | Phi(N) Extraction | ‚ùå Failed | No simple relationship found |
| 11 | Product Analysis | ‚ÑπÔ∏è Insight | e1*e2 is exactly 1024 bits! |
| 12 | Bezout Combinations | ‚ùå Failed | Creates mixed result |

### Key Insights Discovered
- `e1 * e2` has exactly **1024 bits** (half of N's 2048 bits)
- `gcd(e1, e2) = 1`
- Bezout coefficients: `a*e1 + b*e2 = 1` where a, b are ~512 bits
- The polynomial system is solvable but requires computer algebra

## Technical Details

### Why Pure Python Can't Solve This

The challenge requires solving:
```
(2p + 3q)^e1 ‚â° c1 (mod N)
(5p + 7q)^e2 ‚â° c2 (mod N)
p * q = N
```

Where `e1, e2 > 2^512`. This requires:

1. **Polynomial operations** over Z/NZ
2. **Groebner basis** computation or **resultants**
3. **Root finding** for high-degree univariate polynomials

These are available in:
- ‚úÖ SageMath
- ‚úÖ Mathematica
- ‚úÖ Specialized crypto libraries with Coppersmith
- ‚ùå NOT in standard Python

### Computational Complexity

| Operation | Complexity | Feasible in Python? |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| x^(2^512) | Impossible | ‚ùå No |
| Newton's method for 512-bit roots | Years | ‚ùå No |
| Groebner basis | Polynomial | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs CAS |
| Coppersmith's method | Lattice reduction | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs fpylll |

## Conclusion

This is an **advanced cryptographic challenge** that demonstrates:
- Limitations of direct root extraction
- Need for polynomial algebra systems
- Importance of choosing the right tools for crypto problems

**To actually solve it**: Use SageMath with the provided `solve_sagemath.py` script.
